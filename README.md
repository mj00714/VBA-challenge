<h1>VBA-challenge</h1>
<h3>Bootcamp VBA challenge</h3>

<p>This VBA code is to be used in conjunction with the multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file (not included in this repo). The purpose of the code is to take daily stock performance across a portfolio of tickers and consolidate them into their yearly performance (total change, percent change and total volume), by stock ticker. The code also returns: 1) the greatest % increase, 2) the greatest % decrease and the greatest total volume (ticker and volume). The code performs these tasks over 3 years of data, separated out by year on each Excel worksheet. To run the code, copy and paste the vba script into the multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx (macro enabled) workbook then execute the macro.</p>

<h3>Reference instructions:</h3>
  
  <h1>Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>The ticker symbol</li>
  <li>Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</li>
  <li>The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</li>
  <li>The total stock volume of the stock.</li>
  <li>Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"</li>
  <li>Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once</li>
  </ul>
